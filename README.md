# Vanilla JavaScript { snippets }

I'm a huge nerd :nerdface: of vanilla javascript. I've built a few websites on it, as well as a few libraries and still has a long way to go to. This repository serves as a library of commonly used boilerplate code for all things vanilla javascript.

## Contributing

If you were wondering, I'd be happy to have more code snippets here. Have a suggestion or a bug fix? Just open a pull request or an issue. Include the code snippet with a clear file name and the simplest HTML possible.
