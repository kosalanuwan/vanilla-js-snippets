# Vanilla JavaScript { snippets }

[<img align="right" alt="JavaScript" width="128rem" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/javascript/javascript.png"  />][all-things-js]

I'm a huge nerd :nerd_face: of [vanilla javascript (JS)][all-things-js]. This repository serves as a library of helper functions and boilerplate code written with native javascript and browser APIs instead of major frameworks and libraries.

### On this repo

- `boilerplate-*` are code templates to get started with various patterns and practices
- `helper-*` are micro-libraries written for various needs and wants which I typically either copy & paste as and when needed
- `example-*` are partials mixed and matched in order to demonstrate a bit more complexed implementations

## Learning Resources

Nowadays, vanilla javascript already cover most of it anyways. And, polyfills are there whenever some random feature doesn't support on the browser.

- [You Don't Need Lodash and Underscore][learning-yagni-repo] shows what vanilla javascript methods and techniques to use instead
- [Financial Times polyfill repository][learning-polyfills-repo] is good for polyfill code snippets

### A few crash courses

- [All things javascript channel][cc-all-things-js] is a great source to get started
- [Vanilla javascript crash courses][cc-vanilla-js] has 10+ videos on JS and DOM manipulation
- [Documenting your javascript crash course][cc-jsdoc] demos on JSCode
- [Scss crash course][cc-scss]

### A couple of more

- [Node JS crash course][cc-nodejs]
- [NPM crash course][cc-npm]
- [Yarn package manager crash course][cc-yarn]
- [Gulp task runner crash course][cc-gulp]

## Contributing

If you were wondering, I'd be happy to have more code snippets here. Have a suggestion or a bug fix? Just open a pull request or an issue. Include the code snippet with a clear file name and the simplest HTML possible.
