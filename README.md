# Vanilla JavaScript { snippets }

[<img align="right" alt="JavaScript" width="128rem" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/javascript/javascript.png"  />][all-things-js]

I'm a huge nerd :nerd_face: of [vanilla javascript][all-things-js] (JS). I've built a few websites on it, as well as a few libraries and still has a long way to go to. This repository serves as a library of commonly used boilerplate code for all things vanilla javascript.

**On this repo**

- `$qsa.js` is to alias the `document.querySelectorAll` to traverse thru DOM elements
- `$.js` is a micro-library for manipulating DOM as angular's $q
- `format-string.js` is to replace strings as C# `String.Format()`
- `snake-case.js` is to style strings to 'snake_case' as Lodash `_.snakeCase()`
- `mixin.js` is to allow `prototype` option for helper functions as Lodash `_.mixin()`
- `script-data-src.js` is magic code to replace `<script>` tags with attribute `data-src` with new `HTMLScripElement`

### `$qsa.js`
`$` aliases the `document.querySelectorAll()` to traverse thru DOM elements for manipulation.

```js
$('a').each(function(el) { 
  el.addEventListener('input', console.log);
});
```

### `$.js`
Micro-library for manipulating DOM as angular's jqLite but with most frequent use ones to manage classes, attributes, and to traverse thru DOM elements.

```js
$('.highlight-source-js')
   .each(function(el) { 
    console.log(el.innterHTML);
  })
  .hide();
```

### `format-string.js`
Replaces strings based on the format specified as C# `String.Format()`.

```js
_.format('{0} there! It's actually {1}', 'Hello', '/KP');
// expected output: 'Hello there! It's actually /KP'
```

### `snake-case.js`
Style strings to 'snake_case' helper as Lodash `_.snakeCase()`.

```js
_.snakeCase('Library of vanilla JS snippets');
// expected output: 'library_of_vanilla_js_snippets'
```

### `mixin.js`
Allow `prototype` option for helper functions as Lodash's `_.mixin()`.

```js
String.prototype.toSnakeCase = _.mixin(_.snakeCase);
// or
_.mixin(_.snakeCase, String, 'toSnakeCase');

// then use as
sometext.toSnakeCase();
```

### `script-data-src.js`
Replace `<script>` tags with attribute `data-src` with new `HTMLScripElement` and attributes.

```html
<script async
      data-src="../scripts/tokenizer.js" 
      data-client-id="{{client_id}}">
</script>
<script async
      data-src="../scripts/gtm.js" 
      data-client-id="{{ga-key}}">
</script>
<script async src="script-data-src.js"></script>
```
