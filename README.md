I'm a huge nerd :nerd_face: of [vanilla javascript][all-things-js] (JS). I've built a few websites on it, as well as a few libraries and still has a long way to go to. This repository serves as a library of commonly used boilerplate code for all things vanilla javascript.

### On this repo

- Concatenate strings as C# `String.Format()`
- Snake case strings an Lodash `_.snakeCase()`
- Allow both prototype and function options as Underscore String
- Create `<script />` tag on the go to load javascript
- `$` and `$$` aliases for DOM manipulation as jqLite
- Perform action against DOM query selections as Protractor `elements()`

## Contributing

If you were wondering, I'd be happy to have more code snippets here. Have a suggestion or a bug fix? Just open a pull request or an issue. Include the code snippet with a clear file name and the simplest HTML possible.
