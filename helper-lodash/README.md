# Lodash Helpers

A mix and match of a collection of helper functions found in utility libraries, bundled into `global` namespace. In other words, think of it as a stripped-down version of Lodash and Underscore.js libraries :nerd_face:!


### On this repo

- `mixin` allows `prototype` option for helper function as `_.mixin()` does
- `snake-case` for styling strings to `snake_case` as Lodash `_.snakeCase()` does
- `string-format` is to replace strings as C# `String.Format()` does
