# Lodash Helpers

A mix and match of a collection of helper functions found in utility libraries, bundled into `global` namespace. In other words, think of it as a stripped-down version of Lodash and Underscore.js libraries :nerd_face:!

### On this repo

- `_.format` is to replace strings as C# `String.Format()` does
- `_.kebabCase` for styling strings to `kebab-case` as Underscore does
- `_.mixin` allows `prototype` option for helper function as Lodash does
- `_.snakeCase` for styling strings to `snake_case` as Lodash does
- `_.isblank` for determine whether the text is empty or whitespace as Underscore-string does
- `lodash-string.js` enables the prototype option for string literals to use the nano-library.
