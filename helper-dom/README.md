# DOM Selector

A mix and match of a collection of helper functions for DOM manipulation, bundled into `global` namespace or `window` object. In other words, think of it as a stripped-down version of jQuery library :nerd_face:!

### Getting Started

For minimum requirements, you will need followings:

- [An editor, like VS Code][download-vscode]
- [A development local server, like Live Server for VS Code][youtube-vids-liveserver], and
- [A web browser, like Brave][download-brave] as for javascript playground

### Run from Source

[You'll want to copy the source and paste it on the browser console, then play around with those methods by calling it.][youtube-vids-dom-qs]
